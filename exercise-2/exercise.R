### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)

# What was the 2015 salary of employee 57

emp.57 <- salaries[57, "salaries.2015"]
print(emp.57)

# How many employees got a raise?

yay.raise <- nrow(salaries[salaries$got.raise == TRUE,])
print(yay.raise)

# What was the value of the highest raise?

highest.raise <- max(salaries$raise)
print(highest.raise)

# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?

best.employee <- salaries[salaries$raise == highest.raise, 'employees'] 
print(best.employee)

# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
largest.decrease <- min(salaries$raise)

# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
worst.employee <- salaries[salaries$raise == largest.decrease, 'employees']
# What was the average salary increase?
avg.sal <- round(mean(salaries$raise), 2)

### Bonus ###

# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory
write.csv(salaries, file = "Salaries.csv")

# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?
loss <- salaries[salaries$raise < 0,]
print(loss$raise)
# Is that what you expected them to lose based on how you generated their salaries?
answer <- "Yes. Because the salaries were generated randomly, I expected to get these random losses
